## Technical Challenges
- The Animal Crossing API crashed on the second day of the project, and I was unable to access any of the album cover images or music. I ended up using various Animal Crossing sites as a quick fix â€” links to the album covers from Nookazon, song titles from a fan-made excel sheet, and links to the music files from Nookipedia.
- I had never worked with an audio html element, so changing the currently playing music presented issues until I added a useEffect hook to pause the previous song and play the current one.

## Future Improvements
- store the album covers and music in Cloudinary so application not reliant on Nookazon or Nookipedia
- add genres to songs
- add sort by recently added, alphabetical, genre to song list and playlist
- add button to play all music in playlist in order
- caching song covers
